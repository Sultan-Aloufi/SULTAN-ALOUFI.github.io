Can I ulter its behavior while its running? Yes, by a technique called Hooking. It works by intercepting function calls or messages passed between programs. The code that handles the interception is called a hook.
So here is my challenge, I&amp;rsquo;ve to explain to you how function hooking works without any detail compromise.</description></item><item><title>Typing Sensitive Info, Check The URL First?</title><link>https://sultan-aloufi.github.io/posts/browser-in-browser-attack/bitb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 12:24:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sultan-aloufi.github.io/posts/browser-in-browser-attack/bitb/</guid><description>Most of you check the url before typing any sensitive info to guarantee that info will be sent to the website you intended to. There is https://www.chase.com and there is https://www.chase.co/. You also check the padlock to insure the connection is encrypted so even if your internet traffic is being monitered, the data is encrypted so only you and chase.com know how to encrypt them. The middle man only knows you went to chase.</description></item></channel></rss>
