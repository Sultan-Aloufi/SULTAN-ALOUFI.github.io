#### I'm a Computer enthusiast who spends most time learning about computers and how they work. I mainly focus on Cybersecurity, Operating Systems, Networks, and Machine Learning


## Projects/Research
- Dr. Luyi’s Security Research Team (Current)
    - Research and investigate a real-world cybercrime discovered by the team in 2019 on popular Android and iOS apps called Cross Library Data Harvesting (XLDH)
    - Perform static and dynamic analysis on popular iOS and Android apps to detect malicious SKD’s integrated by the app for XLDH cases that stealthily steal user-sensitive data.
    - Detect cross library calls and reflection techniques when disassembling iOS apps that integrate possible malicious SDKs for possible data harvesting that violates victim SDK terms of service. 


- Simple RAM File System Modeled After The ext2 File System
    - Implemented a simple file system completely in RAM for the Xinu operating system modeled after the ext2 file system in Linux
    - Wrote core system calls to interact with the filesystem in the C language to be able to open, close, create, seek, read, write, link, and unlink files
    - Wrote a testing framework in C to test the implementation of the system calls and cover edge cases
